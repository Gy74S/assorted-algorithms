# Assorted Algorithms
Hello Gary in the future, here's your cringy code.

|Program|Info|
|---|---|
|<span>true false practise</span>|<b>Oct 2019</b><br>First piece of code I uploaded to github in this previously private repo, held here for SenTimEnTaL vAluE.|
|magic_knights_tour|<b>Aug 2020</b><br>Generates a magic knights tour - a path for a knight from any starting move such that the knight reaches every square on a chess board once, and ensures that if we were to plot the turn that the knight reached a certain square on the chess board, the sum of the turns on every row and column of the chess board is equal. <br>Uses a backtracking solve involving regular quartes, Warnsdorff's heuristic and quad backtracking.|
|markov_chain_text|<b>Sep 2020</b><br>Reads a text file, and then generates a new piece of text using the same immediate word probabilities of the original text. <br>Generates a weighted directed graph, where each vertex is a word, which points to words that came after it in the text, and the weight is the number of times the word appeared after it. The text is generated through a markov chain.|
|reversi|<b>Sep 2020</b><br>A 2 player board game where you aim to have the most squares filled. <br>Hoping to implement a minimax AI with alpha beta pruning/ further heuristics.|
