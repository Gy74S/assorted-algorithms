<h1>Assorted Algorithms</h1>
A bunch of algorithms that I decided to showcase. If I'm currently working on something at the moment, the most recent commit will be in the dev branch. 
<br><br>


## true false practise
<b>[Link](true&#32;false&#32;practise.py) | Oct 2019</b></br>
First piece of code I uploaded to github in this previously private repo, held here for SenTimEnTaL vAluE.

## magic knights tour
<b>[Link](magic_knights_tour.py) | Aug 2020</b><br>
<b>Generates magic knights tour given any starting point.</b>
<br>
Uses a recursive backtracking solve involving regular quartes, Warnsdorff's heuristic and quad backtracking.
<br><br>


## markov chain text
<b>[Link](markov_chain_text.py) | Sep 2020</b><br>
<b>Reads text file, and generates a new piece of text using the same immediate word probabilities.</b></br>
Generates graph of words from given text. New text is generated through markov chain, where the next word chosen is based off the current word and original text's probabilistic rules.

## reversi
<b>[Link](reversi) | Oct 2020 | (Work in progress) </b><br>
<b>A command line implementation of the board game 'Reversi' along with an AI to play against.</b></br>
Algorithms used: minimax, move sorting, alpha beta pruning, transposition table, and zobrist keys. Heuristics used: mobility, corners captured, frontier length, stability, and predetermined value of square.
